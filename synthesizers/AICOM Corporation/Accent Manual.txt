A table of contents, list of tables and list of figures have been
provided at the beginning of this manual.  Numbered paragraphs
and subparagraphs allow for easy reference.

1.1           INTRODUCTION TO
              ACCENT PRODUCTS

Accent speech synthesizer is a high quality text-to-speech
convertor.  It converts ordinary ASCII text into intelligible speech. 
Accent's unlimited vocabulary capability, plus its many feature
options, comprise a useful voice-output device for various
applications.

To cover a wide range of the system configurations, cost
requirements, and environmental requirements, six different
Accent models are available to the user.  These six models are:
Accent-PC for PC plug-in; Accent-MC for IBM microchannel PS/2
plug in; Accent-SA for stand-alone operation; Accent-mini for PC
plug-in; Accent-1600 for Toshiba laptop models T1100-plus, T1200,
T1600, T3100SX, and Toshiba portable models T3100-20, T3100E,
T5100, and T5200; and Accent-XE for Toshiba laptop model
T1000SE.

For the PC/PS2 and Toshiba plug-in models, the text and
commands (three-character escape sequences) are sent to Accent
through a re-entrant device driver provided, while the stand-alone
model through an RS232C serial port with either hardware or
Xon/Xoff protocol.

All Accent models employ the standard Accent text-processor which
can speak in two modes:  the text mode and the spell mode.

In the text mode, Accent will convert text into ordinary speech,
employing grammatical rules for parsing phrases and sentences,
for words having two pronunciations, for abbreviations, $ amounts,
numbers, and special signs (#,%,& and so on).  In the text mode,
Accent also employs punctuation marks for sentential intonations. 
Through software commands, speech parameters such as average
pitch, Accent's voice characteristic, and speech rate, among others,
can be programmed.  In the spell mode, all text including
punctuation will be spoken letter by letter.

Accent's standard vocabulary is larger than the 20,000 most
commonly used words with precise pronunciation.  For special,
customized vocabulary, a standard DCD (Downloadable Custom
Dictionary) utility is provided, in addition to the phoneme input
capability.  The DCD hardware is built in for all Accent models.

2. INSTALLATION

The installation for each specific model may be carried out by the
user and is described in the following sections.

2.1           INSTALLING ACCENT-PC

This Section describes step-by-step how to install the Accent-PC in
the PC for standard operation, and how to connect to an external
power supply for stand-alone operation (custom system integrations 
only).  When setting up the hardware, please refer to Figure-1 which 
shows the locations of the switches, jumpers, and connectors on 
Accent-PC's printed circuit board.

2.1.1         SWITCH SETTINGS

SW1 SETTINGS

SW1 is used to set up the RS-232C baud rate, the parity bit and
the length of the data bits.  Factory default is set to select 9600
baud rate, parity disabled, and 7 data bits.  To change the baud
rate, parity option or data bit length, please refer to Section 3.1.2. 
The default settings for SW1 have positions 4 and 8 ON and
positions 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 OFF.
    
SW2 SETTINGS

SW2 is used to assign the PC's I/O addresses to Accent-PC. 
Factory default addresses are set to 2A8-2AB Hex, which will not
conflict with any PC, PC/XT, or PC/AT standard or reserved I/O
device.  The default settings for SW2 have positions 1, 3, 5, 7 ON
and 2, 4, 6, 8 OFF. Should these default addresses conflict with
any custom built I/O device or if there is to be more than one
Accent-PC installed in a single PC, please refer to the following
paragraphs for appropriate address settings, and to Section 3.1.1
for changing the same addresses in Accent-PC's device driver.

Four consecutive I/O addresses of the PC bus are possessed by each
Accent-PC.  The address always starts with an even number as a
multiple of four.  The starting address may be selected by setting
SW2 (location shown in Figure 1).  SW2 is an 8 position switch,
each position (starting from 1) corresponding to an address bit
(starting from 0) of the PC bus is listed as follows:

SW2 POSITION:                1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8

ADDRESS BIT:     A0    A1    A2    A3    A4    A5    A6    A7    A8    A9

When a SW2 position is set to "ON", its corresponding PC address
bit is set to "0", and vice versa.  "A0" and "A1" are ignored when
setting up SW2; they are "0" for calculating the starting address.

2.1.2         JUMPER SETTINGS

J2 SETTINGS
     
J2 is used to select Accent-PC's host.  Factory default setting
selects the PC as host.  To select the PC as host, pin 1 and pin 2
of J2 should be jumpered together, using the jumper header
provided.  To select the RS-232C as host, pin 2 and pin 3 of J2
should be jumpered together.

J4 SETTINGS

J4 is used to connect the Reset signal from the PC bus to
Accent-PC.  Factory default provides jumpered J4.  If J4 is
jumpered, whenever the Reset signal from the PC bus is active
(asserted), Accent-PC will be reset.  If J4 is not jumpered,
Accent-PC will automatically reset itself only during power-up.  To
use external power supply for stand-alone operation, J4 must not
be jumpered.

FIGURE-1 Accent-PC Hardware

(Not Shown)

2.1.3         INSTALLING ACCENT'S
              SOFTWARE DEVICE DRIVER

>From the Demo/Utility diskette provided, copy the following files
to a system diskette or the hard disk which is to be used with
Accent:  

SPKACNT.SYS (COPY to the filename CONFIG.SYS)
SPKACNT.DVC
DEMO.BAS
DEMO.TXT

NOTE: For Accent-mini/1600/XE, COPY SPKEMS.SYS instead of
SPKACNT.SYS to the CONFIG.SYS file and COPY SPKEMS.DVC 
instead of SPKACNT.DVC for the device driver.

If there are other device drivers already installed in the system
diskette, the file CONFIG.SYS should reside in the system
diskette.  If this is the case, then instead of copying the file
SPKACNT.SYS or SPKEMS.SYS from the Demo/Utility diskette,
simply add (edit) the following statement(s) in the resident file
CONFIG.SYS :

DEVICE=SPKACNT.DVC          for Accent PC/MC
or
DEVICE=EMM.SYS
DEVICE=SPKEMS.DVC           for Accent-mini/1600/XE 

Re-boot the PC with the system diskette, and if the message
"Accent-PC/MC Device Driver (Version 4.0) Installed", or "Accent
EMS Device Driver (Version 4.0) Installed" for Accent-mini/1600/
XE appears on the screen then Accent's device driver has been
successfully installed.  If not, carefully go through the device driver
installation procedures again.

Note: If you did not have the EMM.SYS loaded prior to the
SPKEMS.DVC, or if you did not reserve at least 64k bytes of the
expanded memory for Accent-mini/1600/XE, the statement
"SPKEMS: EMS Manager Not Present or No Available Expanded
Memory" will appear on the screen.  In this case the
SPKEMS.DVC will automatically use 121k bytes of the
conventional memory.

Accent's default device name and auxiliary device name are "SPK"
and "LPT3" respectively.  After the hardware installation,
COPYing any text or text file to either "SPK" or "LPT3" will cause
Accent to speak the COPYed text or text file.  Also after the
hardware installation, every time the Accent device driver is
loaded, Accent will verbally prompt "ACCENT READY.".

Accent's demonstration program DEMO.BAS is written in IBM
PC's BASIC Language, so that the system diskette to be used with 
Accent must contain the BASIC Interpreter "BASIC.COM" or
"BASICA.COM". 

2.1.4         INSTALLING ACCENT-PC
              HARDWARE

After turning off all power to the PC, Accent-PC may be plugged
in the PC.  First, the bottom of the metal bracket on the Accent-PC
board should be slid into the bracket slot located at the edge of
the PC mother board.  Then Accent-PC should be held upright and
pushed symmetrically down into the PC edge connector.  Finally,
install the screw tightly to secure Accent-PC's metal bracket
against the PC frame. 

2.1.5         SPEAKER CONNECTION

An external speaker may be connected using a 3.5mm male
miniature phone plug (mono).  An 8-Ohm or 4-Ohm speaker is 
recommended.  There is no external speaker needed for Accent-
MC/1600/XE installations.

2.1.6         RUNNING THE DEMO PROGRAM

Only when Accent-PC is properly installed, a speaker has been
connected, and the volume has been turned up to approximately
1/3 (clock-wise), may the PC be powered up.

When the PC prompts, type in "BASIC DEMO" or "BASICA
DEMO" (DEMO232 for Accent-SA) to execute the demonstration
program.  If Accent says "AICOM..." at this point, Accent has been
successfully installed.  If not, turn off the power and go through
the installation procedures again, making sure, among other
things, that the switch settings are correct for your particular
application.

In the DEMO diskette provided, there is a document file named
"READ.ME" which explains the applications of each file provided.

2.1.7         EXTERNAL POWER SUPPLY FOR
              STAND ALONE OPERATION

If Accent-PC is to be integrated into a custom system for
stand-alone operation, power to Accent-PC must be provided
through PS1.  PS1 is a 5-pin male power connector (Molex
09-64-1051 compatible).  Any suitable female connector may be
used to plug into PS1.  Power requirements are listed in Section 7. 
Please note that stand-alone operation is for advanced
users only.  The Warranty is void for, and does not cover,
stand-alone operation. 

Power connections for PS1 are the following:

Pin-1  GND
Pin-2  Key (not used)
Pin-3  -12 volt
Pin-4  +5  volt
Pin-5  +12 volt
Pin-6  Not Used

2.2           INSTALLING ACCENT-MC

This Section describes step-by-step how to install Accent-MC in a
microchannel PS/2.

2.2.1         JUMPER SETTINGS

J1 SETTINGS

J1 is used to connect the Reset signal from the microchannel bus
to Accent-MC.  Factory default provides jumpered J1.  If J1 is
jumpered, whenever the Reset signal from the microchannel bus is
active (asserted), Accent-MC will be reset.  If J1 is not jumpered,
Accent-MC will automatically reset itself only during power-up. 

All other jumpers should not be installed for proper operation.

2.2.2         INSTALLING ACCENT-MC
              SOFTWARE DEVICE DRIVER

All software installation procedures are identical to those of
Accent-PC except the following:  The first step in the software
installation is to reconfigure your PS/2 with Accent-MC's Adapter
Descriptive File, named @6152.ADF, from the Accent Demo/Utility
diskette.  Refer to Section 2.1.3 to install the software device
driver. 

2.2.3         INSTALLING ACCENT-MC

Accent-SA's RS-232C interface is configured as a DCE device.
Please refer to Section 3.1.2 if software Xon/Xoff handshaking is
used.

SW1 is used to set up the RS-232C baud rate, the parity bit and
the length of the data bits.  Factory default is set to select 9600
baud rate, parity disabled, and 7 data bits.  To change the baud
rate, parity option and data bit length, please refer to Section
3.1.2.  The default settings for SW1 have positions 4 and 8 ON,
and positions 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 OFF.

2.3.2         SPEAKER CONNECTION

An external speaker may be connected using a 3.5mm male
miniature phone plug (mono) or  external headphones using a
3.5mm male miniature phone plug (stereo).  An 8-Ohm or 4-Ohm
speaker is recommended.

2.3.3         POWERING UP ACCENT-SA

Turn on the Accent-SA power switch only after the following have
been done:

       The Accent-SA is properly set up and connected to a host.

       An external speaker or external headsets are attached, if
       desired.

       The AC adaptor is connected to Accent-SA and plugged into
       the wall.

       The volume has been turned up to approximately 1/3 
       (clock-wise).

diskette provided, copy the DEMO232.BAS and DEMO.TXT files
to a system diskette containing IBM PC's BASIC Interpreter
"BASIC.COM" or "BASICA.COM".  Then go to Section 2.1.6 to run
the Demo program.

2.4           INSTALLING ACCENT-mini

This Section describes step-by-step how to install Accent-mini in
the PC.  If your PC does not have any non-standard card, the
default settings of Accent-mini's hardware and software device
driver should function properly without any change.

If your PC has any non-standard card, which uses I/O addresses
3EE-3EF Hex or hardware interrupt IRQ2/IRQ9 (IRQ2 is named
for the PC/XT, and IRQ9 is named for the PC/AT), please refer to
Figure-3 to resolve any conflict, and to Section 3.1.1 to change the
same parameters in Accent-mini's device driver before the

Accent-XE board.  Turn Accent-XE's volume up to 1/3.

After the hadware installation is complete, refer to Section 2.1.6 to
run the Demo Program.


3. OPERATION

This Section describes Accent's user-interface and software
command options.  The hardware setup during the installation will
define Accent's interface options, and the software commands will
allow users to change the system options, and to request status
from Accent.

The host computer communicates with Accent as a peripheral
device either via the software device driver or via the RS-232C
port.  If Accent is used with a software device driver on a PC, the
PC BUS protocol is automatically handled in the device driver. 
The user-interface to the software device driver is explained in
Section 3.1.1.

If the RS-232C interface is used, the handshaking for the RS-232C
can either be hardware (Default) or Xon/Xoff type.  The RS-232C
interface is described in Section 3.1.2.

3.1           INTERFACE TO ACCENT

The following two sections (Section 3.1.1 through 3.1.2) are model
dependent, the user may refer to the appropriate sections for any
specific model.

3.1.1         DEVICE DRIVER INTERFACE

This section is not for Accent-SA.  A device driver is used so that
an application program (usually written in a High Level Language)
may communicate with a specific device such as a disk drive, a
printer, or a COM port.  If the system diskette used to boot the PC
has a device driver in it, the PC will automatically load the device
driver during boot time.  Each device driver has its specified name. 
Accent's default device name is SPK.  

After the device driver has been loaded into the PC, any
application program can OPEN or CLOSE the device as a disk file,
READ and WRITE may be performed to that device.  The device
names are reserved (can't be used elsewhere) by the system once
they are installed.

Since Accent is a special device (not a standard device, such as a
standard PC printer), a custom-built device driver is needed to
allow the user to access Accent, that is, to OPEN, CLOSE, READ
and WRITE Accent like a standard device with a specific name. 
In this case, the name of Accent's character device driver is SPK.

Please refer to IBM PC DOS Technical Reference manual for
detailed descriptions of Installable Device Drivers.  Accent's device
driver is a character device driver, and it provides the functions
of INIT, INPUT, and OUTPUT as described in the DOS Technical
Reference.

Although Accent's device drivers are re-entrant, the Calls to DOS
will not be re-entrant.  Therefore an alternative entry is provided
-- the LPT port.  Since Calls to LPT port (by using INT 17H) is
through the BIOS, which is re-entrant, only Calls from LPT to
Accent will be re-entrant.  The default LPT port for Accent is set
to LPT3.  The following shows the LPT interface definitions:

FUNCTION:     Print Character  
ENTRY:        Same as IBM BIOS              
RETURN:       Same as IBM BIOS
NOTE:         None 

FUNCTION:     Initialize           
ENTRY:        Same as IBM BIOS              
RETURN:       Same as IBM BIOS
NOTE:         Accent will be Flushed.  This includes all previous
              inputs, text and commands. FOR A QUICK 
              FLUSH, USE THIS FUNCTION.

FUNCTION:     Status Read
ENTRY:        Same as IBM BIOS
RETURN:       Same as IBM BIOS for AH bit-0, and bit-3 to bit-7. 
              AH bit-2,1 = 00 for not end-of-speech.            
              AH bit-2,1 = 01 for complete end-of-speech.
              AH bit-2,1 = 10 for near end-of-speech (about 0.3
              to 2 second to end.) 
              DH = Index-marker-count (only if <ESC>YZ
              command has been previously issued).
NOTE:         With the index marker feature enabled, if a 
              constant status-check loop is performed to the 
              device driver LPT BIOS call, Status Read, the loop
              time-period is recommended to be at least 20 
              milliseconds.

FUNCTION:     Accent's Foot Switch Status Read (For Accent-MC
              Version 4.0 or higher only).
ENTRY:        AH = 12 Hex
RETURN:       AL = Foot Switch Status;
                      Bit 0 = Not used
                      Bit 1 = 1 for Fast-forward (Left) switch being
                             pressed
                      Bit 2 = 1 for Play (Center) switch being
                             pressed
                      Bit 3 = 1 for Rewind (Right) switch being
                             pressed
NOTE:         If a constant status-check loop is performed on the
              Foot Switch, the loop time period is recommended
              to be at least 20 milliseconds.

If Factory default setups for the system parameters and
configurations are not desired, the utility program SETACNT.EXE
for Accent-PC/MC, or SETMINI.EXE for Accent-mini/1600/XE, may
be used to change them.  Please refer to the menu when running
the SETACNT.EXE or SETMINI.EXE.

3.1.2         RS-232C INTERFACE

This section is only for Accent-PC/SA.  Accent's RS-232C is a
standard serial interface port for Data Communication Equipment
(DCE).  If hardware hand-shaking is adopted, the RTS, DTR, CTS
and DSR signals must be used/checked for proper operation.  If
software Xon/Xoff handshaking is adopted, the software command
<ESC>=V must be sent to Accent first after power-up for proper
operation.  After Accent has received the <ESC>=V command, the
CTS and DSR signals will be asserted by Accent at all times, and
the RTS and DTR signals from the host will not be checked by
Accent.

To ensure hardware engineers of a clear understanding of the
RS-232C signals, each signal on the 25-pin RS-232C D-connector
is listed below for reference.

25-PIN               I/O           RS-232C        RS-232C
CONNECTOR            TO/FROM       SIGNAL         SIGNAL
PIN NUMBER           ACCENT        NAME           SOURCE 

       1             BOTH          PGND           BOTH
       2             INPUT         TXD            DTE
       3             OUTPUT        RXD            DCE
       4             INPUT         RTS            DTE
       5             OUTPUT        CTS            DCE
       6             OUTPUT        DSR            DCE
       7             BOTH          SGND           BOTH
      20             INPUT         DTR            DTE
      22             OUTPUT        RING           DCE

The RS-232C options include baud rate, parity, and data bit
selections. SW1 (refer to FIGURE-1 for Accent-PC, and FIGURE-2
for Accent-SA) is used to set these options, as follows:

BAUD RATE

SW1 POSITION         1      2      3      4       5

75                   ON     OFF    OFF    OFF     ON
150                  OFF    ON     OFF    OFF     ON
300                  ON     OFF    OFF    OFF     OFF
600                  OFF    ON     OFF    OFF     OFF
1200                 OFF    OFF    ON     OFF     ON
2400                 OFF    OFF    OFF    ON      ON
4800                 OFF    OFF    ON     OFF     OFF
9600                 OFF    OFF    OFF    ON      OFF

PARITY

SW1 POSITION         6      7

NONE                 OFF    OFF
ODD                  ON     OFF
EVEN                 ON     ON

The data bit length is set up by SW1 position 8: ON for 7 data bits,
OFF for 8 data bits.  The stop bit is fixed at 1 bit.  Factory default
settings for these options are: 9600 baud, no parity, and 7 data
bits.

3.2           SOFTWARE COMMANDS

Once Accent hardware has been set up, operation is completely
under control of the host.  Accent can accept two kinds of data
from its host: text (including phoneme input), and commands.  Text
may be translated into speech and commands will control Accent's
operation. 

In the text mode, input text from the host is stored in Accent's text
buffer and will not be spoken until a sentence punctuation mark
is received, the time-out described in Section 3.2.1.12 is
encountered, or a <CR> is received if the option in Section 3.2.1.13
is enabled.  Section 4 describes Accent's text processing rules in
detail.  In the spell mode, the text input will be spelled out
character by character immediately after it is received.  
Commands are sent from the host to Accent as escape sequences.
An escape sequence is a string of ASCII characters preceded by an
<ESC> character (1B Hex and 27 decimal).  There are four groups
of commands: System option commands, speech option commands,
status request commands, and index marker commands.

An Accent command consists of the <ESC> character immediately
followed by two more characters.  Unless otherwise noted, the
speech option commands and the status request command
<ESC>?S will not be executed until all text, previously sent from
the host, has been processed, that is, until Accent's internal text
buffer has been emptied.  Other commands will be executed
immediately upon receipt of the command.  Illegal Escape
Sequences SHOULD NOT be sent to Accent.

Each command is described in detail in the following sections.  A
Commands Summary table (Table-1), which also gives Accent's
software default settings, is located in Section 3.2.5.  In these
commands, the upper and lower cases are distinguished.  The
model dependent commands are noted in the descriptions.

3.2.1         SYSTEM OPTION COMMANDS

Various system option commands are available for different
application configurations.

3.2.1.1       Reset

              <ESC>=R

Reset Accent, equivalent to power up reset.  If the RS-232C is used
for host interface, allow at least two seconds for Accent to complete
its self-diagnostics.  No data should be sent to Accent during this
two-second period or the data will be lost.  "ACCENT READY."
verbal message will be issued by Accent.  All options will be reset
to Accent's default state.

3.2.1.2       Initialize

              <ESC>=X

Reset Accent, equivalent to power up reset but with no power-on
verbal message replied.  If the RS-232C is used for host interface,
allow at least 100 milli-seconds for Accent to complete its self-
diagnostics.  No data should be sent to Accent during this 100
milli-seconds period or the data will be lost.

3.2.1.3       Flush

              <ESC>=x

All Accent's internal text/speech buffers will be flushed and speech
will be stopped immediately, all options and status remain
unchanged.  This command is most frequently used to flush the
speech.  Important notice:  Also refer to Section 3.2.1.49 through
3.2.1.51 for Control-X character as instant Flush command and for
Xon-always-sent after Flush.

3.2.1.4       RS-232C Echo On

              <ESC>=E

This command is only for Accent-PC/SA.  Characters received from
Accent's RS-232C will be echoed back to the host device
immediately.

3.2.1.5       RS-232C Echo Off

              <ESC>=e

This command is only for Accent-PC/SA.  Characters received from
Accent's RS-232C will not be echoed back to the host device.  This
is the power-up default state. 

3.2.1.6       Enable Appending <CR> for Status
              Reply

              <ESC>=C

The reply to the Status Request Commands in Section 3.2.3 will
have a <CR>, Carriage Return, appended at the end.  This
command is useful for application software written with
High-Level Languages.  This is the power-up default state.

3.2.1.7       Disable Appending <CR> for Status
              Reply

              <ESC>=c

The reply to the Status Request Commands in Section 3.2.3 will
not have a <CR> appended at the end.

3.2.1.8       Enable Speech Synthesizer

              <ESC>=A

Text received from the host will be converted to speech.

3.2.1.9       Disable Speech Synthesizer

              <ESC>=a

Text received from the host will not be converted to speech and
will not be stored in the text buffer either.  All other options are
unaffected.

3.2.1.10      Speech Pause

              <ESC>=Q

Speech will be stopped (paused) immediately, or after the current
syllable is spoken if Accent is speaking.  Further text input from
the host will be stored in the text buffer and not spoken until a
Speech Continue Command described in Section 3.2.1.11 is
received.  If Accent is in the Speech Pause state, only the Speech
Continue, Reset, Initialize, Flush, Set Average Pitch, Set Speech
Rate, and Set Voice Characteristic commands will be accepted.

3.2.1.11      Speech Continue

              <ESC>=q

Accent will continue to speak, beginning where speech was stopped
(paused) by the Speech Pause Command described in Section
3.2.1.10.

3.2.1.12      Host Input Time-out

              <ESC>Tn

This command is only for Accent-PC/MC/SA.  The n in this escape
sequence represents any digit 0 through 9, which determines the
time-out period while Accent awaits text input from the host.  The
time-out period ranges approximately from 0.04 seconds to 20
seconds for digits 0 through 9.  Any higher digit doubles the
time-out period of the preceding lower digit. 

With any occurrence of time-out, if there is text in the text buffer
with no end-of-sentence punctuation or a terminating <CR> (if the
option in Section 3.2.1.13 is enabled), Accent will begin to speak
out the text.  Default time-out is set to 7, which gives a time-out
period of about 5 seconds.

3.2.1.13      Enable <CR> as Alternative
              Start-Speaking Character

              <ESC>=F

Accent will start speaking when a <CR> is received.  This
command is useful for Screen-Review applications for the visually
impaired.  However, it may slightly affect sentence intonation.

3.2.1.14      Disable <CR> as Alternative
              Start-Speaking Character

              <ESC>=f

Accent will start speaking only when a sentence punctuation mark
is received, or the host input time-out is encountered.  This is the
power-up default state.

3.2.1.15      Enable CTL-Q/S as Xon/Xoff
              Characters

              <ESC>=V

This command is only for Accent-PC/SA.  Xon/Xoff software hand-
shaking will be turned on for the RS-232C.  The Xon character is
Control-Q (11 Hex) and the Xoff character is Control-S (13 Hex). 

IMPORTANT NOTE: If Xon/Xoff is to be used, this command
should be sent to Accent immediately after power-up.  After Accent
has sent an Xoff to the host, there are still 128 bytes free space for
input.  If further inputs exceed the 128-byte limit, buffer overrun
will occur.  For Accent-PC, Accent's host must be set to RS-232C
before this command can be issued.

3.2.1.16      Disable CTL-Q/S as Xon/Xoff
              Characters

              <ESC>=v

This command is only for Accent-PC/SA.  Accent's Xon/Xoff
software handshaking will be turned off.  The RS-232C protocol is
controlled by the RTS, DTR, CTS, and DSR hardware signals.

              Chained Operation

              <ESC>=Z

The description of this escape sequence is not for Accent-SA.
Characters received from LPT auxiliary device will be processed by
Accent, and the same characters will also be sent to the original
software interrupt vector (by a FAR JUMP) previously saved by
the device drivers during system-boot.  For example, if the LPT
number is set to 1 (by SETACNT.EXE or SETMINI.EXE) and the
LPT chain flag is set, all text sent to Accent via LPT1 or PRN will
be spoken by Accent, and will also be sent to the standard system

              <ESC>HP

This command is for Accent-PC only.  Set the PC as Accent-PC's
host.  When Accent-PC is first powered up, the host is selected by
Hardware J2 as described in Section 2.1.2.  This command allows
users to change the host and utilize the auxiliary port for
communication with a second host or with a peripheral, as desired. 
Note: when Accent-PC's host is changed by a set-host command, all
options and status in Accent-PC remain valid, except that they will
then be referred to the newly designated host.

3.2.1.48      Set RS-232C Host

              <ESC>HS

This command is for Accent-PC only.  It sets the RS-232C as

the power-up default state.

3.2.1.51      Enable Xon-Always-Sent after Flush

              <ESC>=I

This command is only for Accent-PC/SA.  If Accent is in Xon/Xoff
protocol mode, this command will cause Accent to always send an
Xon to the host after Accent has been Flushed by the host.  This
Xon is mainly used to signal the host that all index marker
Auto-Prompts (as described in Section 3.2.1.53) have been sent to
the host.

3.2.1.52      Disable Xon-Always-Sent after Flush

              <ESC>=i

This command is only for Accent-PC/SA.  If Accent is in Xon/Xoff
protocol mode, Accent will send an Xon to the host after a Flush
only if an Xoff has been previously sent to the host.  This is the
power-up default state.

3.2.1.53      Enable Index Marker Auto-Prompt

              <ESC>=Y

command enables the foot switch status to be replied whenever a
Status Request command is sent; refer to Section 3.2.3 for the
replied information of the foot switch.  This option allows for the
control of such functions as fast forward, rewind, and resume.

If a constant loop is used for the status request, a delay is
recommended for each loop.  The recommended delay time is the
same as the Status Request (refer to Section 3.2.3).

3.2.1.56      Disable Foot Switch Status Reply

              <ESC>=w

This command is only for Accent-MC/SA Version 4.0 or higher. 
The foot switch status will not be replied when a Status Reply
command is sent, refer to Section 3.2.3.  This is the power-up
default state.

3.2.2         SPEECH OPTION COMMANDS

This command group applies to all Accent models, it allows the
user to tailor Accent to speak text and punctuation marks in a
number of desired formats according to the requirements of a
specific application.  Furthermore, the speech rate, the average
(baseline) pitch, the voice characteristic, the Space pause time,
sentence level intonation, as well as the internal abbreviation
dictionary and schwa sound manipulations can be programmed
through these commands.

3.2.2.1       Text Mode

              <ESC>OT

Text from the host will go through Accent's text processor for
speech output.  This is the normal text-to-speech operation.

              <ESC>OP

Punctuation marks will be spoken as described in Section 3.2.2.10
and Section 3.2.2.11.  This command may be used, for example, in
applications where the punctuation marks must be spoken out
precisely, such as in reading a program written in a High-Level
Language.

3.2.2.5       <-> Not Spoken

              <ESC>Om

              <ESC>OR

If Punctuation Spoken command is enabled as in Section 3.2.2.4,
all punctuation marks will be spoken as described in Section 4.1. 
This is the power-up default state.

3.2.2.11      Subset Punctuation Spoken

              <ESC>Or

If Punctuation Spoken command is enabled as in Section 3.2.2.4,
only ,.:;!? punctuation marks will be spoken as described in Section
4.1.

3.2.2.12      <A> and <a> Always Spoken as /EI/

              <ESC>OA

The character <A> and <a> will always be pronounced as /EI/
phoneme rather than context dependent.

3.2.2.13      <A> and <a> Pronunciation are
              Context Dependent

              <ESC>Oa

The character <A> will always be pronounced as /EI/ phoneme,
while the character <a> is context dependent.  In most cases, the
<a> will be pronounced as the schwa phoneme /UU/.

3.2.2.14      Set Average Pitch

              <ESC>Pn

The n in this escape sequence represents any digit, 0 through 9,
which determines the average pitch level of Accent.  The range of
the average pitch is from about 70Hz to 140Hz for digits 0 through
9.  The nominal and default pitch level for Accent is 5, which gives
an average pitch of about 115Hz.

3.2.2.15      Set Voice Characteristic

              <ESC>Vn

The n in this escape sequence represents any digit, 0 through 9,
which determines the characteristic of Accent's voice.  The lower
numbers will give lower and deeper sounding voices.  The higher
numbers will give higher and sharper sounding voices.  Usually,
when the average pitch is set at a lower number, the voice
characteristic will also be set at a lower number to match, and vice
versa. 

However, for special applications such as Games, this parameter
may be set to any number and, in conjunction with other Speech 
Option Commands, will provide two thousand voices representing 
different personalities.  The default number for this parameter is
set to 5 which will give a male voice of average tone.

3.2.2.16      Set Speech Rate

              <ESC>Rn

The n in this escape sequence represents any digit, 0 through F (in
Hex), G, and H, which determines the speed of Accent's speech
(speech rate).  With the Space Pause Time set to 0, the speech rate
runs from about 120 words per minute to about 800 words per
minute for those 18 digits from 0 to H.

3.2.2.17      Set Sentence Level Intonation

              <ESC>Mn

The n in this escape sequence represents digits 0 through 4.  If n
is 0, the regular (full) intonation will be employed, and if n is 1, a
robotic monotone pitch (using the average pitch level set by the
command described in Section 3.2.2.14), ranging from 60 Hz to 150
Hz, will be employed.

If n is 2, 3, or 4, the regular intonation is employed yet the
sentence level intonation is reduced with respect to n=0, while n=4
has the least sentence level intonation reduction, and n=2 the most
sentence level intonation reduction.

For high speech rate output, for example, in Screen-Review
applications, the reduced intonation (or the monotone) will provide
a more comfortable listening.  For proof-reading type of
applications, the reduced intonation is also useful.  This command
applies to both the text mode and the spell mode.

3.2.2.18      Set Space Pause Time

              <ESC>Sn

The n in this escape sequence represents any digit, 0 through 9,
which determines the pause time for the Space character between
two words. Lower numbers represent shorter pauses, and higher
numbers represent longer pauses.  The default is set to 0, which
gives the most natural sounding speech. 

3.2.2.19      Set Number Processor

              <ESC> Nn

The n in this escape sequence represents any digit, 0, 1, and 2,
which determines Accent's number processing level.  Accent's
number processor is described in Section 4.1.3 and 4.1.4.

For n=0, Accent's number processor is turned on.  If a word has
number(s) mixed in it, the word portion will be spelled out
automatically.  This is the power- up default state.

For n=1, Accent's number processor is turned on.  If a word has
number(s) mixed in it, the word portion will be spoken as a word. 
This mode is most commonly used in the Screen-Review
applications for faster speech delivery.

For n=2, Accent's number processor is turned off.  All numbers will
be spoken digit by digit.  If a word has number(s) mixed in it, the
word portion will be spoken as a word.

3.2.2.20      Direct Parameter Input to Synthesizer
              Chip

              <ESC> |~..~

This command is for advanced users only.  It allows the host to
send parameters directly to the synthesizer chip on the Accent
board.  The synthesizer chip on the Accent board is the AI901.

The .. in this escape sequence represents the parameters (in ASCII
Hex numbers) to be sent to the synthesizer chip.  The direct
Parameter Input may be terminated at any time with a ~ (tilde)
character.  The Interrupt will be handled internally.  To use this
feature, the parameters must meet the following conditions.  Refer
to the chip's specification for parameter definitions.

       Use upper case Hex numbers only: 0-9, A-F.

       Only the Phoneme Response and the Transitioned Pitch 
       modes are allowed.

       The 5-byte parameters should be sent in reverse order:  the
       Filter-Frequency byte first, the Phoneme and Duration byte
       last.

       The lower nibble of any given byte is sent first.

       Upon receiving the first 5-bytes of the parameters (10 
       characters), Accent will start speaking.

       The parameters sequence may be infinitely long.

3.2.2.21      Fixed Abbreviation Pronunciation

              <ESC>OL

This command is only for the abbreviated words designated by note
2 in the abbreviation table in Section 4.1.1.  If this command is set,
an abbreviated word designated by note 2 will always be
pronounced in the non-note 2 form.

3.2.2.22      Automatic Abbreviation Pronunciation

              <ESC>Ol

This command is only for the abbreviated words designated by note
2 in the abbreviation table in Section 4.1.1.  If this command is set,
any abbreviated word will automatically be pronounced according
to the abbreviation pronunciation rules contained in Section 4.1.1. 
This is the power-up default state.

3.2.3         STATUS REQUEST COMMANDS

There are four commands for the host to request specific status
from Accent. If a constant status-check loop is performed to Accent
via the RS-232C port, the loop time-period is recommended to be
at least 50 milli-seconds.  

The Foot Switch option is supported only for Accent-SA and
Accent-MC; Version 4.0 or higher.  If the Foot Switch Reply is
enabled through the <ESC>=W command, refer to Section 3.2.3.2
for Accent-SA's reply definition, and refer to Section 3.1.1 for
Accent-MC's reply definition (through the device driver).

The Reply Synthesizer Status command is most frequently used for
checking Accent's speech buffer status.

3.2.3.1       Reply End of Speech

              <ESC>?S

When speech has ended, Accent will reply with a capitalized
character <S>.

3.2.3.2       Reply Synthesizer Status

              <ESC>?s

This request will be immediately replied with a status-character
by Accent.  If the synthesizer is idle (not speaking, speech ended),
Accent will reply with a capitalized character <S>.  If the
synthesizer is speaking, and is not near to the end, Accent will
reply with a lower-case character <s>.  If the synthesizer is
speaking but near to the end (about 0.3 second to 2 seconds of
speech left, dependent on the speech rate), Accent will reply
with an <M> for more text to have uninterrupted speech.  For
host-interface using the RS-232C, the index-marker-count will be
appended right after the status-character if (and only if) the
index-marker-count replying is enabled as described in Section
3.2.4.5.

If the Foot Switch is enabled, an extra byte will be appended to the
above replied data.  The reply definition is as follows:

Bit 0 = Not Used
Bit 1 = 1 for Fast-Forward (Left) switch being pressed
Bit 2 = 1 for Play (Center) switch being pressed
Bit 3 = 1 for Rewind (Right) switch being pressed

3.2.3.3       Verbal Reply Version Number

              <ESC>|1

Accent will speak out its text-processor Version number for
identification.

3.2.4         INDEX MARKER COMMANDS

The index marker feature is mainly used in the Screen-Review
applications.  It allows the application programs to track exactly
which word in a given text Accent has spoken to, so that the
screen cursor (or pointer) movement can be synchronized with the
speech.

Accent can accept two kinds of index markers, the Control-F
character or a user defined escape-sequence.  The Control-F is
recommended since it takes less memory space and less time to
process.  The marker will be treated as a Space character by the
Accent text-processor, and it is recommended to be placed right
after the word to be marked.

If the host-interface is through Accent's RS-232C port, the host has
two methods to obtain Accent's marker status: through the
Auto-Prompt feature or through Accent's Status-Reply command
<ESC>?s.  With the Auto-Prompt feature (Section 3.2.1.53)
enabled, Accent will automatically prompt the index marker
character to the host each time a marked word has been spoken
(also refer to Section 3.2.1.51 and 3.2.1.52).  With the Status-Reply
command enabled for replying the index-marker-count, Accent will
append the index-marker-count (in one-byte binary form) to the
status-character (S, M, or s), and then clear Accent's
index-marker-counter for a new count. Either of the above two
methods may be used, but NOT BOTH at the same time.

If the host-interface is through Accent's device driver, the index
marker is supported only through the LPT BIOS call, Status Read. 
With the Status-Reply command enabled for replying the
index-marker-count, on return of the LPT BIOS call, Status Read,
the DH register contains the index-marker-count (in one-byte
binary form), and Accent's index-marker-counter is cleared for a
new count.  Refer also to Section 3.1.1.

3.2.4.1       Enable CTL-F as the Index Marker

              <ESC>YX

Accent will treat the Control-F character (06 Hex) as the index
marker.

3.2.4.2       Disable CTL-F as the Index Marker

              <ESC>Yx

Accent will not treat the Control-F character (06 Hex) as the index 
marker.  This is the power-up default state.

3.2.4.3       Reply <ESC>Y plus Index-Marker
              Character for Auto-Prompt

              <ESC>YY

This command is only for Accent-PC/SA.  The <ESC>Y plus the
index- marker character (one character) will be sent to the host via
the RS-232C port when Accent is prompting the index marker in
the Auto-Prompt mode.  This three-character prompt is used only
if the host needs an escape-sequence for index marker prompt.

3.2.4.4       Reply Index-Marker Character only
              for Auto-Prompt

              <ESC>Yy

This command is only for Accent-PC/SA. Only the index-marker
character (one character) will be sent to the host via the RS-232C
port when Accent is prompting the index marker in the
Auto-Prompt mode.  This is the power-up default state.

3.2.4.5       Enable Index-Marker-Count Replying
              for Status Reply

              <ESC>YZ

For host interface using the RS232C, the index-marker-count will
be appended to the replied status for the <ESC>?s command.  For
host interface using the device driver, the index-marker-count will
be returned in the DH register for LPT BIOS call, Status Read. 
Note: The index-marker-count should be checked frequently enough
so that it does not overflow.  It is recommended that the time
between two checks should not be over five seconds if every word
in the text has a marker.

3.2.4.6       Disable Index-Marker-Count Replying
              for Status Reply

              <ESC>Yz

No index-marker-count will be replied.  This is the power-up
default state.

3.2.4.7       User Defined Index-Marker

              <ESC>Y_

This three-character escape-sequence is the user defined index-
marker. The <_> character represents the user defined index-
marker character which may be any character A-W, a-w, or 0-9. 
Once a <_> is used, it should not be altered.  This user defined
index-marker is used only if the host must use an escape-sequence
as the index-marker.

3.2.5         TABLE-1 (Command Summary)

4. STANDARD ACCENT TEXT PROCESSOR

Accent's text processor is standard for all Accent models.  A set of
legal ASCII characters is defined for Accent's text processor. 
Illegal characters will be ignored and not pronounced.  The legal
characters are here listed :

!"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~ 

plus <SP>, <CR>, <LF>, and <HT>.

The Accent text processor employs a highly sophisticated
text-to-speech algorithm.  Text may be input with or without
capital letters (unless otherwise specified, as for the abbreviations).
The key to, and the only requirement for, attaining natural,
intelligible speech with Accent is that the input text must be
properly punctuated as in normal writing.  Hyphens should not be
omitted in hyphenated words.  Pauses are automatically inserted
into speech by punctuation marks and rules.  If longer pause is
required, consecutive sentence ending punctuation marks (.:;!?)
may be used.  The following Sections describe each pronunciation
rule in detail.

4.1           PRONUNCIATION RULES

Punctuation marks will not be spoken by Accent in normal text
mode unless the option is enabled by the command described in
Section 3.2.2.4.  To insure natural speech from Accent, any word
(or special sign) with a punctuation mark following it may have
only one or no Space character, <SP>, between the word and the
punctuation mark.  Each ASCII character which Accent considers
to be a mark of punctuation is here listed :

SIGN          TYPE                 SPOKEN

<SP>          Word end             Space
,             Phrase end           Comma
(             Phrase begin         Left Paren
[             Phrase begin         Left Bracket
{             Phrase begin         Left Brace
)             Phrase end           Right Paren
]             Phrase end           Right Bracket
}             Phrase end           Right Brace
"             Phrase begin/end     Quote
.             Sentence end         Period
;             Sentence end         Semicolon
:             Sentence end         Colon
?             Sentence end         Question
!             Sentence end         Exclamation

The <`> (grave accent) character is used to mark a stress for its
following syllable in a word.  It may be placed anywhere within a
word which is not an Arabic number, an abbreviation, or a special
sign.  ASCII characters which Accent considers to be special signs
are listed with their pronunciations as follows:

SIGN          SPOKEN               SIGN           SPOKEN

&             And                  *              Star
@             At                   |              Bar
=             Equals               _              Underline
>             Greater              <              Less
#             Number               %              Percent
/             Slash                \              Back Slash
+             Plus

$             Dollar (also see Section 4.1.3) 
-             (See Section 3.2.2.5 through 3.2.2.7)

4.1.1         ABBREVIATIONS

An abbreviation may be input without a period following it unless
it is at a sentence end or otherwise noted.  A capitalized initial
letter (the first letter) may not be required unless otherwise noted. 
Accent's abbreviations list includes the following :

Note (1):     Must have an ending period.
Note (2):     Must have a capitalized initial letter and an ending
              period.

Besides the preceding abbreviations, Accent includes hundreds of
other commonly used abbreviations which are normally "spelled
out" (such as EIA, CCITT, CIA, USA, USSR, SOS, etc.) when
pronounced.  Such abbreviations are not listed here.  Note: if there
is no vowel letter in an abbreviated word , it will automatically be
spelled out by Accent.

4.1.2         ALTERNATIVE PRONUNCIATIONS

A special feature of Accent's text processor is that grammatical
rules are applied to words with two pronunciations, and
adjustments are automatic.  If this feature is not desired (such
as in a single-word pronunciation), a <^> immediately following an
ambiguous word will elicit that word's alternative pronunciation.

4.1.3         MONETARY $ AMOUNTS

The following examples show different ways of specifying monetary
amounts, which may be spoken as high as trillion(s) :

Input :       $1
Speech:       One dollar

Input :       $235  
Speech:       Two hundred thirty-five dollars

Input :       $.10  
Speech:       Ten cents

Input :       $0.10  
Speech:       Zero dollar and ten cents

Input :       $1.234  
Speech:       One point two three four dollars

Input :       $1.26
Speech:       One dollar and twenty-six cents

Input :       $6723
Speech:       Six seven two three dollars

Input :       $30,456.17
Speech:       Thirty thousand four hundred fifty-six dollars and
              seventeen cents

4.1.4         NUMERALS

Any number having five or more digits without a comma inserted
is pronounced digit by digit.  Four-digit numbers without leading
zero(s) will be pronounced as two pairs of two-digit numbers.  If a
number has a comma inserted at every third digit, the following
counting units are available :  Hundred, Thousand, Million, Billion,
and Trillion.  For any number with a decimal point, a leading digit
must be present, otherwise it will be treated as a period. 
Following are examples of how Accent pronounces numerals:

Input :       16
Speech:       Sixteen                       

Input :       1986
Speech:       Nineteen eighty-six

Input :       168
Speech:       One six eight

Input :       0304
Speech:       Zero three zero four

Input :       1,663
Speech:       One thousand six hundred sixty-three

Input :       166-1688-K8

Input :       (408)453-8251
Speech:       Four zero eight, four five three, eight two five one

Input :       #123-45-6789
Speech:       Number one two three, four five, six seven eight 
              nine

4.1.5         TIME OF DAY

Input :       12:45
Speech:       Twelve : forty-five 

Input :       7:07
Speech:       Seven : zero seven 

4.1.6         WORDS WITH NO VOWEL

If a word has no vowel letter it can not be pronounced, and Accent
will automatically spell it out.  The vowel letters are A E I O U
and Y.  Examples of such words are PM, BC, KWPP, etc.  If a word
containing vowel letters goes through Accent's text processor but
the resulting phoneme sequence has no vowel in it, that word will
also be spelled out.  Examples of such words are NE, YE, etc.

4.2           PHONEME INPUT

The beginning and ending of a phoneme input string to Accent
must be marked by a <~> character.  Immediately following the
beginning mark is a </> character.  In a phoneme input string
sequence, each phoneme is separated by the </> character, and the
sequence must be ended by a </> character. 

The Space, Comma, and Period punctuation marks can also be
embedded in a phoneme sequence.  No word should exceed 32
phonemes in length.  The standard phoneme symbols used for
Accent products are listed in TABLE-2.  The following shows an
example of the phoneme input:

Text:         This is a test.

Phoneme:      ~/DH/X/I/S/ /I/Z/ /UU/ /T/'/E/S/T/./~

or            This ~/I/Z/~ a ~/T/'/E/S/T/./~

5. STANDARD ACCENT DCD UTILITY

The DCD utility is a development software which runs on an IBM
PC for generating the user's own customized dictionary as DCD
files.  If needed, the DCD file can be uploaded from the PC to any
host and then downloaded to Accent by the COPY Command
appropriate to that host's Operating System.  All Accent models
have a built-in, 4k-byte memory block which can hold
approximately 250 10-character words.  Once the DCD is
downloaded, Accent will always search through the DCD first for
any given word during the text-to-speech processing.

5.1           DCD SOFTWARE OPERATION

To generate a custom dictionary for Accent, the DCD development
software (the program named DCD.EXE on the diskette provided)
and a DCD source file are needed.  The DCD source file may be
created (with any Editor for straight ASCII characters) under any
file name with any file extension.

A sample DCD source file is shown in Section 5.2.4.  The followings
are general rules for creating the DCD source file.

(1) Only upper case characters are allowed.

(2) Legal characters for spelling are:

     ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

(3) The spelling, phonemes, and part-of-speech are entered in that
order, and are separated only by two commas.  Phonemes should
conform to the standard Accent phoneme input format as shown in
Section 4.2.1.

(4) The words containing the same first-letter should not exceed
255 in number.  That is, each Alphabetic group should not have
more than 255 words.

(5) No Space character is allowed in the DCD source file.

(6) No empty line is allowed in the DCD source file.

After the DCD source file has been created, the DCD.EXE program
must then be executed (by typing in "DCD xxxxxx.xxx <CR>") to
generate a Hex file and an absolute Object file.  The Hex file will
be used for download.  Both the Hex file and the Object file have
the same name as that of the DCD source file, and the file
extensions are listed as follows:

Hex file:     xxxxxx.DLX
Object file:  xxxxxx.OBJ 

During the generation of the DCD, the <.> will be prompted to
indicate the word count.  Each <.> prompt indicates that ten words
have been processed.

After the DCD Hex file and Object file have been generated, the
memory size (in bytes) of the DCD and the error message (if any)
will be shown on the screen.  The user should check to assure that
the memory size does not exceed 4k bytes.

To download the DCD to Accent, use the host computer's COPY
Command to copy the Hex file to Accent through the
communication link, the device driver or the RS-232C port.  Since
each time a DCD file is downloaded to Accent, it overwrites the old
DCD that was in Accent, multiple DCD applications may be
implemented easily.  To totally disable Accent's DCD search after
a DCD file has been downloaded, simply download the
DUMMY.DLX file to Accent.  The DUMMY.DLX file is in the
Demo/Utility diskette provided.

5.2           RULES FOR BUILDING THE
              CUSTOM DICTIONARY

Any word in the DCD source file must contain only the capitalized
Alphabetic letters.  Because the Accent Text Processor already
processes numerous prefixes and suffixes, the DCD user will save
memory by entering only the root words, and thereafter testing for
any of their derivatives which he wishes Accent to speak. 

The correct part-of-speech for each entry word is required for the
text processor to correctly parse the phrase/sentence and generate
more-natural sounding speech.

5.2.1         THE ROOT WORD

Any specific word which is entered into the DCD will always be
pronounced as phonemically entered.  In addition, that word may
combine with various of its prefixes and/or suffixes to form yet
other words which will also be pronounced correctly. 

Nevertheless, due to the complexity of the text processing rules,
internal rule conflicts may result in skewed pronunciation of words
derivative of the root word entered.  Therefore it is suggested that
when any root word is entered into the DCD, all related words for
which the user requires accurate, correct pronunciation be tested
as soon as the DCD has been downloaded. Should a related word
or words be mispronounced (which might happen when, for
example, the word has both a prefix and multiple suffixes), the
user should simply enter the mispronounced word or words into
the DCD.  The Accent text processor supports the following
prefixes and suffixes:

PREFIXES:

ab-           down-         mal-          poly-             sur-

-able         -al           -son          -ment

5.2.2         THE PART-OF-SPEECH

Those parts-of-speech which are to be assigned by the DCD user as
he enters vocabulary items, and which are supported by the Accent
text processor, are listed as follows:

PART-OF-SPEECH              REPRESENTATION

1                           Noun
2                           Verb
3                           Adjective
4                           Adverb
7                           Present Participle
8                           Past Participle
13                          Interjection
19                          Verb or Noun (with same
                            pronunciations)
62                          Verb or Noun/Adjective having -ate
                            as suffix (with different
                            pronunciations)
63                          Verb or Noun (with different
                            pronunciations)

5.2.3         WORDS WITH TWO
              PRONUNCIATIONS

If a word has two pronunciations with 63 as its part-of-speech,
both words should be entered into the DCD adjacently.  The first
word should always have the verb pronunciation, with the
part-of-speech as 63.  If a word has two pronunciations with 62 as
its part-of-speech, only the verb needs to be entered into the DCD. 
The Accent text processor will search for the correct pronunciation
when parsing the sentence.

6. PROGRAMMING ACCENT

The following are some general rules and hints for programming
Accent in various applications:

(1) Once a specific voice (average pitch, speech rate, voice
characteristic, sentence intonation, etc.) has been chosen for
output, the escape sequences along with system option parameters
and DCD (if any) may be sent to Accent as part of power-up
initialization.  The initialization for the Screen-Review applications
is recommended to be <ESC>=F <ESC>=B <ESC>OA <ESC>M4
<ESC>=M <ESC>N1 <ESC>OL.  Other parameters may be user
tailored or selected.

(2) It is important that all text be punctuated normally, and that
compound words be properly hyphenated.  Any word not 
pronounced satisfactorily by Accent may be corrected by using the
DCD, phoneme input, or intentional misspelling.

(3) Speech is often better perceived when the pitch is set at a lower
level.  At low pitch, the speech rate may thus be set at a level
higher than usual without losing intelligibility.  From experiments
and listening tests, <ESC>P3 <ESC>V4 settings give an
average-low male voice with very intelligible, natural sounding
speech for regular text at the default speech rate.

(4) Text and escape-sequence commands for any application may
be entered and tested first using the DEMO.BAS (or
DEMO232.BAS) program provided or any suitable Editor.  After
which the text and/or the escape sequences may be saved as a file
for further use or editing.

(5) The <ESC>=F and <ESC>=B commands will affect sentence
intonation.  They are not recommended for general applications or
for Screen-Review applications when slow speech-rate is used for
proof-reading.

(6) If, for the first-time synthetic speech listener, the word
boundaries in a sentence are not perceived distinctly enough, the 
Set Space Pause Time command may be used to increase the pause
between words.  Medium short, descriptive type of sentences
always give good comprehension to the listeners, especially when
the listeners are expecting certain prompts.

(7) For applications requiring different voices (by using speech
option commands) as well as using the Flush command frequently,
always try to Flush Accent first then send the speech option
commands.  Enable and use the Control-X character as the Flush
command.

(8) For applications requiring frequent, constant Flush of speech,
unless the application program can assure that Accent's input text
buffer is never full by using the Status Request command in
Section 3.2.3.2, the following recommendations should be taken
into consideration: If Accent's device driver is used for host
interface, the LPT port interface should be adopted because it is
re-entrant, speech may be flushed anytime with a Flush command
(LPT's Initialize command).  If the RS-232C is used for host
interface, the Xon/Xoff protocol should be used because even when
Accent has sent Xoff to the host, it still has 128-byte free space for
further text input or Flush command.

(9) This is for Accent-PC only.  In applications requiring a
multi-host configuration, if the text is both to be spoken and to be
sent to the auxiliary port, it is the user's responsibility to
guarantee that the auxiliary port (either the PC or the RS-232C
port) has an uninterrupted receiving capability so that Accent does
not get hung up waiting for the auxiliary port ready.
